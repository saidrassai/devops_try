# DevOps Pipeline - Current Status

## 📊 Infrastructure Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Application Containers**: Both environments deployed and healthy
  - Development: `devops-dev` on port 3000
  - Staging: `devops-staging` on port 3001
- **Health Checks**: All passing
- **Docker Compose**: Successfully running services
- **Jenkins Server**: Running on EC2 instance `i-0e605f03f8a4d2420`

### ❌ What's Failing
- **Jenkins Pipeline**: Build stage fails at npm command
- **Node.js/npm**: Not installed on Jenkins EC2 instance
- **Build Process**: Cannot run `npm install` or `npm test`

## 🎯 Root Cause
The Jenkins pipeline tries to run Node.js commands (`npm install`, `npm test`) but Node.js/npm is not installed on the EC2 instance where Jenkins is running.

## 🔧 Immediate Fix Required
Install Node.js/npm on the Jenkins EC2 instance using AWS Session Manager:

1. Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Instances
2. Select instance `i-0e605f03f8a4d2420`
3. Click Connect → Session Manager → Connect
4. Run the script from `session-manager-nodejs-install.sh`

## 📝 Next Steps
1. **Install Node.js** (15 minutes)
2. **Re-run Jenkins pipeline** (verify fix)
3. **Test applications** (both ports should respond)
4. **Optional**: Update to self-healing pipeline (`Jenkinsfile-auto-fix`)
