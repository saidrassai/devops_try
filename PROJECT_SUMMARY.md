## 🌐 **Target Environment**
- **EC2 Instance**: i-0e605f03f8a4d2420
- **Public IP**: 3.86.184.138
- **Multi-Environment Setup**: dev/preprod/prod

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Deployment**

### **Option 1: AWS Session Manager (Recommended)**
1. Go to AWS Console → EC2 → Instances
2. Select instance `i-0e605f03f8a4d2420`
3. Click "Connect" → "Session Manager"
4. Copy and paste the deployment commands from `Deploy-Alternative.ps1`

### **Option 2: Fix SSH & Use Automation**
1. Fix security group (allow port 22 from your IP)
2. Verify SSH key is correct
3. Run: `.\Deploy-Now.ps1`

### **Option 3: Manual Setup via Console**
1. Connect via AWS Console
2. Follow the step-by-step commands
3. Test endpoints

## 🎯 **Application URLs (After Deployment)**
- **Main Application**: http://3.86.184.138:3000
- **Health Check**: http://3.86.184.138:3000/health
